First, I would likely recommend the [CSDIY](https://csdiy.wiki) website which really give a help to me when I was missing in the subject. And most of the content below is modified from it to suit the SQA student needs. 

Secondary, you may have been facing with the judgement - for study or for play. As for this subject, you have ability to acknowledge  the cutting-edge technology news or catch up with whatever you like, it depends on yourself! XD

Thirdly, when it comes to the English ability, yeah I know most of students(includes me, even this article has grammatical errors) have trouble learning or using this language. However, it is necessary to master itself since there are tons of references or courses that using or speaking in English but you have to learn. Thus, improve yourself and to be a better student!

	when learning the SQA courses or before

	This the special courses from MIT where as you see, the courses called *Missing Semester*, is used to compensate for the fundamental knowledge, you have to know but no one tell you
