I would like recommend you to use [Obsidian](https://csdiy.wiki) to record or even write report. But in this section, there are another sections I want to apply:
## Markdown
Markdown is a language that similar to the normal text editor. For example, in Word, the bold key is `CTRL B` or click the bold button. But in the markdown, just type `**`this is a word`**` to make the text into this - **this is a word**
Thus, here are the advantages of markdown below:
1. Free your mental health
	For your learning process, you will suffering from using keyboard and mouse. It is helpful to make the process more simply and relax(as the same as Vim)
2. supported for all the platform
	Not only the platform but also the software that when open in another software and it mentions that the format does not support for the current software, then cause errors.
3. free time
	very fast when you have mastered, isn't it?

## LaTeX
LaTeX is a language for essay or others' construction form that help you to arrange the format.

## Vim
I would like you to read this page for [Vim](https://csdiy.wiki)
In conclusion, vim could help you to make the coding and developing more faster.
