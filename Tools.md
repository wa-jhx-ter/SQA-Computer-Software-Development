Tools are the weapons that help you fight with problems or make the development more efficiency.

# VPN
>This is the key to the gate that help you know the international world!

Just like what I have pointed out, it is curial for all the student to have to assess the Internet. Typically, the SQA students who are not have a register on the [CSSD](https://www.chsi.com.cn/en/) do not have any rights as the same as the formal college student, thus they could not have any school VPN. 
However, due to the privacy and laws, I could not recommend any about it. Just remember, the price or other factor depends on your choice. Think more than twice.

# Campus network
> *Make good uses of it!*

When you have read the former part of *VPN*, you could wonder why I am talking about the campus network. Well, some website usually can be accessed like [CNKI](https://www.cnki.net/) with the college verification by using campus network if you are living in the college dormitory.

# Take Notes
>Learn to take notes for yourself

I would like recommend you to use [Obsidian](https://csdiy.wiki/%E5%BF%85%E5%AD%A6%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7/workflow/) to record or even sometimes write report. But in this section, there are another sections I want to apply:
## Markdown
Markdown is a language that similar to the normal text editor. For example, in Word, the bold key is `CTRL B` or click the bold button. But in the markdown, just type `**`this is a word`**` to make the text into this - **this is a word**
Thus, here are the advantages of markdown below:
1. Free your mental health
	For your learning process, you will suffering from using keyboard and mouse. It is helpful to make the process more simply and relax(as the same as Vim).
2. supported for all the platform
	Not only the platform but also the software that when open in another software and it mentions that the format does not support for the current software, then cause errors.
3. less time-consumption
	very fast when you have mastered, isn't it?

## LaTeX
LaTeX is a language for essay or others' construction form that help you to arrange the format.

## Others
I modified the Word, notepad, OneNote and etc. into the Others sections does not mean I have not use these before while giving up for some reasons or intermittently using. **All the text applications are best**, it depends on the inhabitation of individual usage. But I don't think you have to spend too much time on choosing which is better. You have to get accustomed to it, not reverse the subject and object.

# Vim
I would like you to read this page for [Vim](https://csdiy.wiki/%E5%BF%85%E5%AD%A6%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7/Vim/)
In conclusion, vim could help you to make the coding and developing more faster.
If you want to learn it, as for the class, there is a [Missing-semester courses](Courses#Missing%20Semester) for you to have,[here is the official website](https://missing-semester-cn.github.io/2020/editors/)
