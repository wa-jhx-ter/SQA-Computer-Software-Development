    <p>中文请<a href="Chinese/ReadmeCN.md">点击这里</a>，SQA学生请继续阅读，本篇文章不定时更新。</p>

    <h2>Quotation</h2>
    <p>First, I would likely recommend the <a href="https://csdiy.wiki">CSDIY</a> website which really gives help to me when I was missing in the subject. And most of the content below is modified from it to suit the SQA student needs. Thus if you have any questions about the courses, please ask in the <a href="https://csdiy.wiki">CSDIY</a> website.</p>

    <p>Secondly, you may have been facing the judgement - for study or for play. As for this subject, you have the ability to acknowledge the cutting-edge technology news or catch up with whatever you like, it depends on yourself! XD</p>

    <p>Thirdly, when it comes to the English ability, yeah I know most of the students (including me, even this article has grammatical errors) have trouble learning or using this language. However, it is necessary to master it since there are tons of references or courses that use or speak in English but you have to learn. Thus, improve yourself and be a better student!</p>
